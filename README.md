# MERN Stack Tutorial with Deployment - Beginner's Course

This project is a complete implementation of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application, inspired by the FreeCodeCamp tutorial "MERN Stack Tutorial with Deployment â€“ Beginner's Course". The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on guide to building a full-stack web application with these technologies, along with deployment strategies.

## Project Description

This MERN stack application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items. The front end is built using React, while the back end is developed using Node.js and Express. The application interacts with a MongoDB database to store data persistently.
